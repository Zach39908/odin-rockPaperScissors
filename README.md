# odin-rockPaperScissors

Basic introductory Javascript project from the guidelines at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

This is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between the user and computer. Project guidelines request for the game to take place
in the browser console, however I used alert() to make it more interactive on the screen for the user.
